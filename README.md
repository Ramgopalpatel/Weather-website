HTML:

The HTML structure includes a container div with a heading, input field, button, and a div for displaying the weather result.
The JavaScript file is linked at the end of the body.
CSS:

Basic styles for the body, container, heading, input field, button, and weather result are defined.
The layout is centered with a white background for the container.
JavaScript:

An event listener is added to the button, which triggers a function to fetch weather data when clicked.
The fetch API is used to get weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
The weather information is displayed in the weatherResult div if the city is found; otherwise, an error message is shown.
